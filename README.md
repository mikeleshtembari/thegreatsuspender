# The Great Suspender

<img src="/src/img/suspendy-guy.png" width="100px" />

"The Great Suspender" is a free and open-source Google Chrome extension for people who find that chrome is consuming too much system resource or suffer from frequent chrome crashing. Once installed and enabled, this extension will automatically *suspend* tabs that have not been used for a while, freeing up memory and cpu that the tab was consuming.

If you have suggestions or problems using the extension, please [submit a bug or a feature request](https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/). For other enquiries you can email me at greatsuspender@gmail.com.

### New release!
I am currently rolling out a new chrome webstore release. 

**If you have lost tabs from your browser:** I have written a guide for how to recover your lost tabs [here](https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/526
).

### Chrome Web Store

The Great Suspender is [available via the official Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg).

Please note that the webstore version may be behind the latest version here. That is because I try to keep webstore updates down to a minimum due to their [disruptive effect](https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/526).

For more information on the permissions required for the extension, please refer to this gitHub issue: (https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/213)
